# as5600_i2c_arduino
This is a library for the AS5600 magnetic encoder's i2c interface.  Most registers exposed. 

The library is in libs folder.  
 - lib/AS5600.h
 - lib/AS5600.cpp

The main.cpp is a sample project that tests the lib.  It's for esp32 and platformio (arduino platform).  I imagine it'll probably work on other arduino architectures.
